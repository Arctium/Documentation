# Contribution to Arctium Projects

You can contribute to Arctium projects with issues and PRs. Simply filing issues for problems you encounter is a great way to contribute. Contributing implementations is greatly appreciated.

## Reporting Issues

We always welcome bug reports, API proposals and overall feedback. Here are a few tips on how you can make reporting your issue as effective as possible.

### Contribution

### Contributor License Agreement

You must sign a Arctium Contribution License Agreement (CLA) before your PR will be merged. This is a one-time requirement for projects at Arctium. You can read more about [Contribution License Agreements (CLA)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement) on Wikipedia.

The agreement: [arctium-contribution-license-agreement.pdf](arctium-contribution-license-agreement.pdf)

You don't have to do this up-front. You can simply clone, fork, and submit your pull-request as usual. When your pull-request is created, it is classified by a CLA bot. If the change is trivial (for example, you just fixed a typo), then the PR is labelled with `cla-not-required`. Otherwise it's classified as `cla-required`. Once you signed a CLA, the current and all future pull-requests will be labelled as `cla-signed`.

### File Headers

The following file header is used for all Arctium projects. Please use it for new files.

```
// Licensed to Arctium under one or more agreements.
// Arctium licenses this file to you under the MIT license.
```
